  Content:
  - Well Xi, if you're not going to unban Harrison Ford, this is the last tutorial
    you're going to get!
  - From now on, you'll have a limited amount of time, posters, and plushies
  - You get more time, posters, and plushies at the start of every day. At the end
    of every day, the Whole World comes to visit, so you better cover up all the
    atrocities!
  - If you cover up several atrocities with only one poster or plushie, you get to
    take the remainders with you to the next level!
  - Try covering up the two atrocities in this level with only the plushie! Good
    luck!
